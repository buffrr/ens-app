      <H2>Before You register</H2>
      <Section question="What is this?">
        .forever is the first Handshake top-level domain to offer decentralized
        subdomains. It was created by{' '}
        <a href="https://impervious.com">Impervious</a>. Owners of [any
        subdomain].forever will completely own their name on Ethereum. The
        top-level domain .forever has been locked (with no owner), but anyone
        can renew it.
      </Section>

      <Section question="How do I register a .forever domain?">
        We have created a{' '}
        <a href="https://medium.com/@ca98am79/step-by-step-guide-to-registering-a-badass-name-39c3cc38c7a5">
          step-by-step guide to registering .forever domains here
        </a>
        .
      </Section>

      <Section question="Can I use a .forever name for my website?">
        Yes, by using DNS servers that resolve the Handshake root zone and also
        a resolver for ENS names on Handshake, you can build websites on
        .forever domains.
      </Section>

      <Section question="What is the maximum length of a name I can register?">
        There is no limit on the name length.
      </Section>

      <Section question="Can you have names with emojis?">Yes.</Section>

      <Section question="How much does it cost to register?">
        Names are about $45 a year (paid in ETH).
      </Section>

      <Section question="How much gas does it cost to register?">
        It depends on the gas price. You can check the historical registration
        transaction costs
        <a href="https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/48pBVvSxRNVjSE8Ing1uOrCtjD4r3WmV0v5KpS05">
          {' '}
          here{' '}
        </a>
        . "Transaction cost (USD)" query will tell you how much it costs to
        register (commit + registerWithConfig).
        <br />
        Please bear in mind that "registerWithConfig" combines 3 transactions
        (register, set resolver and set eth address) hence the gas cost is
        relatively expensive.
      </Section>

      <Section question="Can I register names other than .forever?">
        We have open sourced all of the software for this so that anyone can
        deploy a registry for their Handshake TLD.
      </Section>

      <H2>When you register</H2>

      <Section question="At step 1, the transaction was slow so I speeded up">
        Our app cannot currently detect that you sped up the transaction. Please
        refresh the page and start from step 1 again.
      </Section>

      <Section question="I am stuck at step 2">
        At times, the counter waits for up to a minute at the end of step 2 to
        make sure that the Ethereum blockchain has progressed. If this continues
        for more than 5 min after moving to step 2, please contact us on
        Discord.
        <br />
        Note that if you leave it at step 2 for more than 24 hours, it gets
        reset and you have to start from step 1 again.
      </Section>

      <Section question="My transaction at step 3 failed">
        This happens occasionally when the USD price changes and you haven't
        registered with enough ETH. Please try again from step3.
        <br />
        Please also be noted that the registration step will expire if you don't
        complete within 48 hrs and you have to start from step 1 again.
      </Section>

      <H2>After you register</H2>

      <Section question="What is the difference between the Registrant and Controller?">
        If your Ethereum address is set as the Controller you can change the
        resolver and add/edit records. Some dapps may set themselves as the
        Controller so they can update records on your behalf.
        <br />
        The Registrant allows you to change the Controller. If you transfer the
        Registrant to an address you don't own, you lose the ownership of the
        name.
      </Section>

      <Section question="What is a Resolver?">
        A Resolver is a smart contract that holds records. Names are set by
        default to the Public Resolver managed by the Impervious team and has
        all the standard ENS record types. You can set your Resolver to a custom
        resolver contract if you,d like.
      </Section>

      <Section question="What is a Reverse Record?">
        A Reverse Record makes your Ethereum address point to an ENS name
        (normally ENS names point to addresses, hence "reverse" record). This
        allows dapps to find and display your ENS name when you connect to them
        with your Ethereum account. This can only be set by you so it is not set
        automatically upon registration.
        <br />
        To set the reverse record, please click "My account", and select
        "Reverse Record".
        <ImageContainer>
          <ReverseRecordImage src={ReverseRecordImageSrc} />
        </ImageContainer>
      </Section>

      <Section question="How do I unregister my name?">
        If you click the "trash bin" icon on the address record, it will unset
        your address so that people can no longer look up your address with the
        name. You can also unset ownership of subdomains in this way, but you
        cannot do so on ".forever" addresses. Because â€˜.forever` names are
        ERC721-compliant NFTs, you cannot transfer them to an empty address
        (0x00000...). You can transfer it to a burn address (eg: 0x00001), but
        that does not erase the fact that you used to own the name. Also, the
        name will not become available for registration again.
      </Section>

      <Section question="How do I transfer my name?">
        For a ".forever" name, transfer both the Registrant and the Controller
        to the new Ethereum account. Since ".forever" names are ERC721 compliant
        NFTs, you can change the Registrant by simply transferring the NFT from
        any NFT compliant wallet/marketplace as well.
        <br />
        For subdomains, click change the Controller to the new Ethereum account.
        Note that transferring the ownership of the name does not change the
        records, so the recipient may need to update them. If the recipient is
        not experienced, it may be a good idea for you to clear your records and
        set the ETH Address record to their Ethereum address before transferring
        the name.
      </Section>

      <Section question="Why are some of my subdomains shown as a jumble of characters?">
        ENS names are stored as a hash on-chain so we have to decode the name
        using a list of possible names, and it shows in the hashed format if we
        don,t have it on our list. You can still access and manage the name if
        you search for the name directly in the search bar.
      </Section>

      <Section question="How do I find the labelhash/namehash of a name?">
        Please refer to the ENS{' '}
        <a href="https://docs.ens.domains/contract-api-reference/name-processing#how-do-i-find-the-labelhash-namehash-of-a-name">
